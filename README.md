This project was my first attempt at a website. I used bootstrap for styling and responsiveness. I plan to go back and redo the website at a later date. 

## What I could start on changing:
-Implement lazyloading on all the images, as well as decrease the resolutions.
-Refactor the custom CSS classes to use more bootstrap, and redo the jumbotron.
-It kind of is responsive, but in some screen sizes I think it looks bad. The Jumbotron is broken in some some views.
-Add a contact form. I didn't use any logic in the project.
